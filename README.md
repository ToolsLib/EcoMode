# EcoMode

âš¡ **EcoMode** is a lightweight Windows utility that helps reduce power consumption and improve efficiency by applying smart system tweaks and process management rules.

## âœ¨ Features

* **One-click Eco Mode toggle**: switch between *Eco ON* (power-saving) and *Eco OFF* (performance) instantly.
* **Windows power plan tweaks**: automatically adjusts *Energy Performance Preference (EPP)* and *Boost* settings.
* **Browser policies**: applies registry policies for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome (hardware acceleration off, battery saver/efficiency mode on).
* **Per-app GPU preferences**: configure applications to use *integrated GPU (power-saving)* or *discrete GPU (performance)*.
* **EcoQoS (Quality of Service)**: throttle background processes while keeping the active foreground app boosted.
* **Configurable bypass list**: define which processes should never be throttled.
* **Tray support**: runs in the background, minimizes to system tray instead of closing.
* **Import / export / reset profiles**: easily back up or share your configuration.
* **Activity log**: console-like log viewer with color-coded log levels.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

1. Download the latest installer from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Run the setup â€” EcoMode will be installed with Start Menu and system tray support.
3. Launch EcoMode from the Start Menu or tray icon.

*(Installer built with Inno Setup â€” no external dependencies needed.)*

## ðŸš€ Usage

* Click **ðŸ”‹ Eco ON** to enable Eco Mode.
* Use the **check boxes** to control which tweaks are applied (Power Plan, Edge/Chrome policies, GPU prefs, EcoQoS).
* Use **Browseâ€¦** to add apps for GPU preference management.
* Add process names to the **Bypass list** if they should never be throttled.
* Right-click the **tray icon** for quick Save / Quit options.

## ðŸ›  Tech

* **C# (.NET WinForms)**
* **P/Invoke (Win32 APIs)** for EcoQoS and power throttling
* **Inno Setup** for installer packaging

## Build and Run (development)

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Deployment

```
# if you want to rely on user's .NET Desktop Runtime (smaller):
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false

# OR ship everything (bigger, no runtime needed):
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```

..then build it with Inno Setup Compiler.

## Code signing

Sign your binaries with a code signing certificate to ensure integrity and authenticity.

```
signtool.exe sign /f "path\to\your\certificate.pfx" /p "your_certificate_password" EcoModeSetup.exe
```

## Notes & tweaks

Tuning values: EPP/Boost numbers are conservative defaults; adjust in ApplyPowerPlan.
